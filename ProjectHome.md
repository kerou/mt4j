**MT4j - Multitouch for Java** - is an open source, cross platform Java framework, created for rapid and easy development of visually rich 2D or 3D applications and is designed to support different kinds of input devices with a special focus on multi-touch support.

The input system is very flexible and also supports the native Windows 7 Touch API as well as open standards like the TUIO protocol and of course normal mouse input. Many standard multi-touch gestures are already built in and can be used modularily with any MT4j component. New gestures can also be defined.

By using the OpenGL graphics standard and a component based scene graph, MT4j applications achieve very good performance on supporting platforms.
